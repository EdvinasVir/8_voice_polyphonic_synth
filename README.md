# 8_voice_polyphonic_synth
Polyphonic synthesizer created as a part of a 'Advanced Interactive Tool Design for Music and Audio' module university assignment. It features a multiple wavetable oscillators, analog modelled sallen-key filter, LFO's, etc.

The project was coded in MaxMSP. The wavetable files are missing from the project, as they were initially borrowed from NI Massive synthesizer for testing purposes and are copyrighted.
